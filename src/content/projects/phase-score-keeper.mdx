## Why'd you start this project?

If you've ever played the card game Phase 10, you find that there are things you need to keep track of
across the 10 phases and many rounds. When I originally played the game with friends, they used an iPhone app
that facilitated this. Unfortunately, there isn't anything quite as useful available for Android and mobile
web. So when my parents bought the game on a whim, they had to write down scores and numbers on a sheet of
paper and use a spreadsheet. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to help them and other people who play the
game out.

I decided to crack my knuckles and write a React SPA. I hadn't used NextJS in a while so I saw this an
opportunity to use it. I also come from a SemanticUI, then a Bootstrap, and then a Material UI background,
so I wanted to break into using Tailwind v4. Once I had the project ready, deploying to Vercel was effortless,
and allowed my end-users (parents) to start their testing process.

There are still plenty of improvements to the app underway, but since my parents have no longer needed to use
pen & paper for their Phase 10 games, I'd consider this project already a success!
