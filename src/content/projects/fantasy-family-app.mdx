## Why'd you start this project?

I've heard about Google's Flutter framework and its claim to "Build apps for any screen", so I decided
to try out codecamp's tutorial for Flutter. It was originally supposed to generate an app name by
combining two words together, but my partner noticed that the names that ended up generated by the
library made for better fantasy family names. So after finishing the tutorial, I gave my own spin on it.
I have also been fascinated by neumorphic styling lately, so I gave the buttons in the app a neumorphic
look to make it clear what is clickable in the app.

I was pleased at how much quicker and lighter it was to run VS Code with the Flutter extension than it was
to run Android Studio. The hot reload for Android was also very handy for the instant development feedback loop.
